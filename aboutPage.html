    <h2>A Little Bit About the Creator</h2>
    <img src="CrowleyAboutImage.png">
    <p>Hi! My name is Kaitlyn Crowley. I am a student studying Data Science and Sociology and I have a passion for learning about climate change and 
        the impacts that it has on communities and individuals. Since climate change contributes to increasingly severe natural disasters, I wanted to explore the 
        current natural disaster data available.
    </p>
    <p>

        For this project, I used the dataset: ALL NATURAL DISASTERS 1900-2021 from Kaggle. 
        The original data was collected from NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). 
        To conduct analysis using demographic data, I combined the EOSDIS natural disaster data with the World Development Dataset, which I also downloaded from Kaggle.
        This data is a compilation of data from the World Bank, the World Happiness Report, and Transparency International.
    </p>
    <p>
        NOTE: I plan to include a little bit of information about what I did to clean/combine the data.
